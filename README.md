# WaterfallArithmeticUnit-Proposal
These are the documents about the theoretical presentation of a Waterfall Arithmetic Unit.

Ideally, the project should be developed using a dynamic Verilog project, using a parameterizable language, conceptually similar to PHP language for HTML pages. 

There are two versions of the document about WAU basic concepts:

- [The English version](WaterfallArithmeticUnit.en.md)
- [The Italian version](WaterfallArithmeticUnit.md)

The concept was conceived by Riccardo Cecchini <rcecchini.ds@gmail.com>, August 2024
